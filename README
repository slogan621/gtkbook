How To Build
------------

The makeall script can be used to build the source code.

To make clean:

$ sh makeall clean

To make:

$ sh makeall

The makeall script recursively descends the source tree and performs make in
all of the source directories (nearly 100 of them).

About the Programs
------------------

These programs were written by me as as a way to experiment with the behavior
of some of the functions in the Gtk+ widget API. In some cases, the behavior
of the program itself is not typical of a high quality application. The most
common example of this handling window closes and quit buttons. Closing a 
window (or hitting a quit button) may not result in the application exiting.
Hitting Ctrl-C in the terminal window or issuing a kill(1) command is the way
to deal with this. I may post new versions of apps that exhibit this behavior
in the future, but don't hold your breath :-)
